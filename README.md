Synopsis

This is the business website for Scargo Cafe that displays general information about the restaurant, the ability to make restaurant reservations, which is also directly emailed to the restaurant

Code Example

The code displays how the site has been created dynamically with php, and synced to display data from a database with MySQL.

Motivation

This project was completed for Scargo Cafe, but the password connecting to the database has been removed to prevent a security breach. The purpose of this project is to present my code thinking to other developers. While this project is not perfect, I think it is a good representative of how I think through my projects.

Installation

Due to required passwords being removed, this project cannot be installed. If you wish to see a live version of this, please go to www.nerdyowl.co/scargo.

Contributors

This project was completed entirely by Keith Anderson originally for a client but presented here as a code sample.
